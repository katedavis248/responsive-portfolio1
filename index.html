                Hi my name is Kate Davis. I was born and raised in Dallas and currently live in a beuaitful house of
                lower greenville. I'm really
                excited to be apart of this program and really hope that a career comes out of it in the end, I did a
                lot
                of research towards this industry and it just seemed very suitable for me. I love the idea that I'll be
                in an industry
                that is both lucrative and creative.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                My hobbies include painting, I love hanging out with my friends, definitely love
                netflix, maybe a little too much.
                I am an avid runner, my days don't start until I get a run in! I also model for local Dallas designers
                and photographers from time to time.

            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                My goals after this program is over is just to be confident that I will have the skills to have a career
                out of this. My goal is
                to move to California in the next year or two.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>I am super excited to be going through this bootcamp and looking forward to all the thing I will learn.
            </p>
